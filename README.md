# :art: Kroxylicious Community Gallery

A gallery of community-built filters for [Kroxylicious](https://kroxylicious.io/), an open source network proxy for Apache KafkaÂ®. The filters in this gallery are not maintained by the Kroxylicious project, but we thought they were too good not to share!

To add your Kroxylicious filter to the gallery, please take a look at our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
